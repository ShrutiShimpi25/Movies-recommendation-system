Movie Recommendation system 
!

ðŸ”Ž What it does:
âœ… Recommend top 5 similar movies using content-based filtering
âœ… Fetch poster and TMDb ratings via API
âœ… Show redirect links to:

Netflix
Hotstar 
JustWatch (global streaming availability)
âœ… Display everything in a user-friendly, responsive UI with aligned buttons and optimized layout

Tech Stack Used:
 Python

Pandas & Scikit-learn (for similarity model)

TMDb API (for poster + rating)

Streamlit (to build and deploy the web app)

 What I learned:

How recommendation engines work under the hood

How to use REST APIs and handle responses

UI/UX design with Streamlit layout features

Debugging real-world integration issues (permissions, missing data, alignment)

Movie Recommender Web App with Python & Streamlit!
After diving deep into recommendation systems, Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest hands-on project: a Movie Recommender System that suggests movies, shows posters, ratings, and links to where you can watch them â€” all in a sleek, interactive UI!
